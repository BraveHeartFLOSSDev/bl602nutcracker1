# bl602nutcracker1
This is Apache Licence 2.0 RE code for the Nutcracker Effort.
This code is not perfect, it is the code I obtained.
I hope you put it to good use.

Latest uploads: These should be of better quality than the first.
These are all the blobs except for the map and txt format.

The Latest Latest uploads: These are the maps and txt files as ascii compressed. I hope this will be useful to you devs. I'm finished with the blobs folder now. I say that...

The Most Recent Uploads, the compressed files, are the result of months of effort and a custom processor implementation into Ghidra. There are a few missing files but it is the best quality code thus far. I will upload these missing files when they are ready.
